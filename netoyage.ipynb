It was self-defense.Damn it, renee,what the hell are you doing with this guy?You're supposed to bring suspects in,not murder them.Until we know who dubaku's source is there,you've got to handle this outside ofthe bureau.Dubaku is the only personwith the names of the peoplewho betrayed you within your governmentit's imperative that we find him.You resigned from government service and thesenate regards you as having been arenegade agent.How am I supposed to know whereyour loyalties really lie?With all due respect,madame president, ask around.I got an address for henry taylor.Get an ambulance!*********no one else gets through here.Follow me.It's henry taylor, the president's husband,but that information is not to bedisseminated. Clear?I...mr. Taylor, don't speak.I need you to save your energy.over here!Excuse me. Step back, please.This is unit six.We have a gunshot trauma to the chest...nine-millimeter round.Nine- millimeter substernal. Pulse is rapid.- Are you okay?- Yeah.I'm gonna call the president.Iwant you to search all the rooms,see if you can get anything off theirhardware that's going to tell us wheredubaku went.******This is jack bauer.I need to speak with the president.Hold one moment, please.Madame president,I would encourage you not to lose hope.Dubaku knows we triedto deceive him, ethan.He has no reason tokeep henry alive.jack bauer is on line one,madame president.Put him through.Mr. Bauer, this is president taylor.Madame president,we have your husband.He is alive, but he sustaineda gunshot wound to the chest.How bad is it?Emts are stabilizing him.They're getting ready to transferhim to west arlington hospital.Mr. Bauer, be more specific.Is my husband going to be okay?We're not gonna know anythinguntil the doctors see him.Ma'am, I have to warn you,he has lost a lot of blood.Jack, it's bill. Do you have dubaku?Negative-- he was gonebefore we got here.Madame president, since your husband wasthe only leverage that dubaku had left,it's safe to say that he istrying to leave the country now.Have you any idea howhe intends to do that?Not at this time.Unfortunately, all his men werekilled during the assault.Agent walker and i will stay behind.We'll continue to search the area.We have to assume that dubaku hasan exit strategy already in place.Whatever we're going to do to find him,we're going to have to do it fast.Yes. Thank you, mr. Bauer.Please keep me apprisedon everything.Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry.I am so sorry, madame president.Ethan, I'm going to thehospital to be with my husband.Ma'am, that's not possible.You're executing amilitary invasion.My generals can execute itperfectly well without me.We can't ignore the fact the secretservice has been compromised.There's no way we can ensure yoursafety outside the white house.I don't give a damn.I am not going to be held prisoner in thisoffice while my husband is fighting forhis life.Now, either find someone to take to thehospital or I'll drive there myself.Madame president,you know my record of service.If it's acceptable to you, I'm willing toassume responsibility for your security.Bill, you're no longer credentialed.You don't have the authority.Until we capture dubaku and interrogate him,we have no idea who in the government isworking for him.You do not know who you can trust.But I can trust you.I brought this conspiracy to your attention,madame president.I would hope that I've earned it.What do you need from me?Reinstate my government clearance, allowme the authority to vet white house staff,and allow me to bring one of my people intofbi to provide larry moss withtactical support.Who is it that you want to bring in?Chloe o'brian.I can vouch for her; she's the best there is.Her clearances were also revokedwhen ctu was decommissioned.Isn't there anyone capable of handling theseduties without our having to reinstate her?Someone in the bureauis on dubaku's payroll.Until we find out who it is, larry moss can'ttake the chance of bringing his own peopleinto a manhunt for dubaku.All right.The director of white house secretservice operations is agent hovis.I'll order him to turn oversecurity protocols to you.I know ted hovis, madame president. He'snot gonna like this; he's gonna fight us.Well, considering that agents under h chargeare responsible for what happened tomy husband,I don't give a damn what he likes.You have your provisional appointment, mr.Buchanan, under the authority of this office.Thank you, madame president.You can thank me bygetting me to the hospital.I'll make the arrangements.Madame president...your concerns are clear to me,ethan, but I've made my decision.I'm only trying to do my job--looking out for your interests.My interest right nowis catching ike dubaku.He has killed scores of americans today,he tried to kill my husband,and he has corrupted our government.Whatever it takes,I want that son of a bitch found.Marika... marika.Samuel, what are you doing here?We need to talk.Uh, okay, well,I get a break in 20 minutes.No, now.Okay, what is it? You're scaring me.Something has come up.I need to leave the country.What? When?Right away.I don't understand.W-when are you coming back?Marika, listen to me.I haven't been entirelyhonest with you.My passport visa expired a couple monthsago and I've been in the country illegally.I'm afraid the immigrationpeople have caught up with me.It was my sister, wasn't it?She reported you, didn't she?That doesn't matter now.What is important is I have to leave thecountry tonight, and I want you to comewith me.Tonight?Marika, we've talked about this.I promised you that one day i would take youaway from here, give you the happiness thatyou deserve.Samuel, I-I want that, too, but...but not tonight, not so soon.Marika, I don't havetime to argue with you!I'm sorry.I can't leave rosa.She needs me; I'm the only one she hasto take care of her. You know that.I know, I know.Which is why she's going to join us.Join us?As soon as possible.I could only arrange ticketsfor both of us tonight,but I want you to promise not to tell yoursister of our plans, at least not yet.I have to; I can't just run off.No, no, no, she might cause trouble for us,make it impossible for us to leave.I promise you your sister will join us withina couple of days of our arrival. Okay?- Our arrival where?- Belize.I have shown you thephotographs of my home there.Do you love me?You know I do.Then trust me. Say you'll come.I'll get my things.I still need to finalize our arrangements.I want you to go home and pack.- Wait for my call.- All right.- Yes.- It's me.Have you made the preparations?Almost.It's been tricky clearinga flight corridorsince faa still has most privateand commercial aircraft grounded.I have faith you'll manage.The arrangements arefor two passengers?Just as you requested.Are you sure you wantto leave now, colonel?I can't imagine general juma will be pleasedto learn that you're abandoning your mission.The mission is over.I have done what I can do.If that is not enough for juma,then to hell with him.I've got your passportsand itinerary in hand.Meet me at our usual spot in half an hour.I'll bring them.No, we'll meet in the lobby ofthe roosevelt continental hotel.That's not a good idea.It'll be crowded there at this hour.I know. I want the meeting earlier.I'll see you in 15 minutes.Go.- I can't get it to boot. Hard drive must be fried.- Damn it.Let's search the bodies.Start with him.- yeah.- Renee, it's me.Bill buchanan just briefedme on your situation.What's henry taylor's status?They've got him in an ambulance enroute to west arlington hospital.I don't know his current condition.Buchanan told me you andbauer were in a firefight.Yeah, we took down six of dubaku's men,but dubaku was gone before we got there.You all right?I've been in worse.******- I'm fine, larry.- Really? I'm not so sure about that.And what is that supposed to mean?I'm looking at a report faxedto me from metro police.A mrs.

I said that it worked.Of course it bothers me.I can see that woman's face.She and her child staringat me with such...she had no idea that her husband wasa killer, a traitor to his country,and she looked at melike I was the monster.- Agent walker.- Hold on.I cross-referenced theinformation on these pdas.I came across somebanking transactions.All from a series of accountsregistered to the same address.- You think it's a safe house?- It's worth a shot.Larry, we may have anaddress on dubaku.21917 euclid street. Apartment six.21917 euclid street, unit six.We're moving out now.Can you provide sat surveillance?Yeah, bill buchanan's sending somebody overto run th, but until she's up and running,you're gonna have to go in blind.Okay. We'll be in touch.- You sure you're okay?- I'm fine.Let's go.Federal investigations continue into theterrorist acts that have gripped thenation's capital,as well as the peopleof kidron, ohio.Despite assurances by president taylor in hernational address that the threat has passedSources at the white house will not confirmthat all those responsible have beenaccounted for.Now, are you sure you'renot gonna need my help?I'm just running fbi opstemporarily until they catch dubaku.Once they find him, hopefully he'll tell usthe names of all the people on his payrollthat are inside our government.And then, we can go home?Then, we can go home.Well, just be careful. All right?'Cause if buchanan's right and dubakuhas someone working inside the bureau...I'll watch my back.You just watch prescott.Okay, sweetheart, mommy has to go to work.You be good, okay?Bye, mommy.- You be good, too.- I will.And if you get all jammed up,you know where to find me.I need you to cross-referenceour deployments with homeland.Make sure the requisitionnumbers match up.After that,you can catch up on the hourlies.Are you joking? That is busy work,administrative crap you're handing me.Janis... I don't have the time or theinclination right now to explain myassignments to you.Just get it done.Agent moss, chloe o'brian justcleared security. She's on her way up.All right, thank you.Janis, set up a secure vpn socket.Port it to the conference room.Why do you need a vpn socket?I'm bringing in a consultant from homeland toconfirm there are no lingering gaps in thecip firewall.That's fine. Take that downstairs.Ms.O'brian, larry moss.Welcome to the fbi.- You can call me chloe.- All right, we're right in here.Buchanan said you'd be up to speed.- I'm up.- Good.Agent walker and bauer are pursuinga potential lead on dubaku.They're en route to this addressin the mount pleasant district.Agent walker's requestingsatellite support.What's the matter?Is something wrong?I'm feeling a little exposed here.If someone out there is working for dubaku,shouldn't we be doing this more covertly?As far as anyone knows,you're working on shoring up our firewall.Besides, this is the only space availablewhere you'll have full access to our server.Our network doesn'tsupport remote modules.That's inefficient.Whoever set your network up that waydidn't know what they were doing.I set our network up that way.Okay.Something else?You worked with bauer for a long time,didn't you?Seven years, on and off.That's impressive.That you survived the experience.What are you talking about?Only that a lot of people didn'T.Curtis manning, ryan chapelle.His own wife.Are you saying it's jack'sfault his wife was killed?You tell me.Jack bauer is the most trustworthy,honorable man I know, and he'sy iend.Maybe you should worry less about him andmore about the mole in your office workingfor dubaku.- Is that chloe o'brian?- What?In the conference room. Chloe o'brian--she was senior analyst at ctu.I once took a seminar she gave.What's she doing here?Larry said homeland sent her over to checkfor residual breaches from thefirewall attack.What?It just doesn't sound likeher area of expertise.Besides, as far as I know, she's beeninactive since ctu was decommissioned.Your passports and travel itinerary.A hawker-siddley 748 isfueling at taft airfield.Be ready to fly within a half hour,get you to the cayman islands.You shouldn't have any troublegetting to belize from there.I need a car to theairfield and a driver.I assumed you had yourown transportation.It's not for me.I see. It's for the girl.Well, I'm not sure I can findsomeone I trust on such short notice.Really?What about your man at the bar?Excuse me?Or one of the two on thebalcony watching us now?Or the two in the black towncar waiting for me to leave?Do you think I am a fool,mr. Burnett?I know you people seeme as a liability now.These men are here to guarantee your safety,colonel, not to threaten it.Guarantee my safety. How nice.And said with such sincerity.I want you to take thismessage back with you.If anything should happen to meon my way out of the country--an accident or an assassinationattempt, anything--if the plane that you were so generousto donate decides to explode,a data file with all the names and banktransactions of all those involvedwill be sent to thejustice department.That is completely uecessary.The same holds true if anythingshould happen to marika donoso.I swear to you,she knows nothing of this.She is no threat to you.Make sure your driver knows thisbefore he brings her to me.Do you understand what I am saying?I want you to tell me that you understandwhat I am saying to you, so there will beno mistakes.- I understand.- Good.The one thing I have learned in thecompany of mercenaries, mr. Burnett,is that ultimately, they care aboutnothing but their own survival. Good day.I was right.Dubaku suspected we weregonna take him out,and apparently, he's assembled evidenceto use as an insurance policy.We need to make sure he gets out ofthe country and safely into exile.Otherwise, we're all compromised.I'll make the calls.What are you doing?Rosa.Where are you going?Rosa, listen to me.We're going away from here. All of us.Well, what do you mean, all?Samuel told me the truth.He's an illegal,just like you thought.He has to leave the country,and I've agreed to go with him.You're leaving me?No, no, only for a short time.You're gonna come, too.Samuel's made plans.

But notthis time.- Marika, I'm begging you, listen to me.- No.Marika, please. Stop.Move!Marika, please.

I'll get back to you.We're on.Marika...we got to go.You-- fbi.You keep her safe, you hear me?We will.I'm really scared.You're going to be fine.Just remember,we're right behind you.Move up here.Now, listen, if you get into trouble,you can signal us by dialing one-zero...no. No, I don't want you to do that.Don't do anything that's going toraise the suspicion of the driver.Okay.You ready?I'm ready.Yeah.What the hell are you doing?She was scared.I wanted her to know there was anotheroption than waiting for us to swoop in.If we're going to find dubaku,there are no other options, you understand?Come on,you've run operations like this.Not without full tactical support,and at least two backup units on the scene.She's naked out there, jack.I don't like it.This isn't about you.This is about her and dubaku.Listen, life gets ugly,innocent people get hurt-- that's a reality.At least she got to make a choice tobe involved, to do the right thing.Which is a lot more than I cansay for dubaku's other victims.We have one job here--that's to get dubaku.Outside of that don't get involved.Chloe, the car's here.Copy that.She's getting in the car.Copy.She's moving. Are you cked in?Yeah, I've got themheading south on 14th.Can you upload the trackinggrid to agent walker's pda?No, I'll have to direct you.Just keep us close.Understood.

Okay?- Our arrival where?- Belize.I have shown you thephotographs of my home there.Do you love me?You know I do.Then trust me. Say you'll come.I'll get my things.I still need to finalize our arrangements.I want you to go home and pack.- Wait for my call.- All right.- Yes.- It's me.Have you made the preparations?Almost.It's been tricky clearinga flight corridorsince faa still has most privateand commercial aircraft grounded.I have faith you'll manage.The arrangements arefor two passengers?Just as you requested.Are you sure you wantto leave now, colonel?I can't imagine general juma will be pleasedto learn that you're abandoning your mission.The mission is over.I have done what I can do.If that is not enough for juma,then to hell with him.I've got your passportsand itinerary in hand.Meet me at our usual spot in half an hour.I'll bring them.No, we'll meet in the lobby ofthe roosevelt continental hotel.That's not a good idea.It'll be crowded there at this hour.I know. I want the meeting earlier.I'll see you in 15 minutes.Go.- I can't get it to boot. Hard drive must be fried.- Damn it.Let's search the bodies.Start with him.- yeah.- Renee, it's me.Bill buchanan just briefedme on your situation.What's henry taylor's status?They've got him in an ambulance enroute to west arlington hospital.I don't know his current condition.Buchanan told me you andbauer were in a firefight.Yeah, we took down six of dubaku's men,but dubaku was gone before we got there.You all right?I've been in worse.******- I'm fine, larry.- Really? I'm not so sure about that.And what is that supposed to mean?I'm looking at a report faxedto me from metro police.A mrs. Carol vossler isclaiming an unidentified womanheld her and her childhostage at gunpoint.She says the womanthreatened to kill her son.Larry, we discussed this.We needed to get vossler to tellus where taylor was being held.It was the only leverage we had.Yeah, right, whatever's necessary.Jack bauer's rationalization forevery unethical action he takes.It worked, larry.Doesn't that count for something?Renee, jack bauer is about to be sung up by asenate subcommittee, and you are followinghis playbook.You already got the ag's office looking intothat thing you pulled with tanner'srespirator, and now this.No one was actually hurt.No one...?Renee, bauer killed the woman's husband!Renee, I swear to you,I am scared of what is happening to you.You put these people throughhell and it doesn't bother you.I didn't say that it doesn't bother me,larry. I said that it worked.Of course it bothers me.I can see that woman's face.She and her child staringat me with such...she had no idea that her husband wasa killer, a traitor to his country,and she looked at melike I was the monster.- Agent walker.- Hold on.I cross-referenced theinformation on these pdas.I came across somebanking transactions.All from a series of accountsregistered to the same address.- You think it's a safe house?- It's worth a shot.Larry, we may have anaddress on dubaku.21917 euclid street. Apartment six.21917 euclid street, unit six.We're moving out now.Can you provide sat surveillance?Yeah, bill buchanan's sending somebody overto run th, but until she's up and running,you're gonna have to go in blind.Okay. We'll be in touch.- You sure you're okay?- I'm fine.Let's go.Federal investigations continue into theterrorist acts that have gripped thenation's capital,as well as the peopleof kidron, ohio.Despite assurances by president taylor in hernational address that the threat has passedSources at the white house will not confirmthat all those responsible have beenaccounted for.Now, are you sure you'renot gonna need my help?I'm just running fbi opstemporarily until they catch dubaku.Once they find him, hopefully he'll tell usthe names of all the people on his payrollthat are inside our government.And then, we can go home?Then, we can go home.Well, just be careful. All right?'Cause if buchanan's right and dubakuhas someone working inside the bureau...I'll watch my back.You just watch prescott.Okay, sweetheart, mommy has to go to work.You be good, okay?Bye, mommy.- You be good, too.- I will.And if you get all jammed up,you know where to find me.I need you to cross-referenceour deployments with homeland.Make sure the requisitionnumbers match up.After that,you can catch up on the hourlies.Are you joking? That is busy work,administrative crap you're handing me.Janis... I don't have the time or theinclination right now to explain myassignments to you.Just get it done.Agent moss, chloe o'brian justcleared security. She's on her way up.All right, thank you.Janis, set up a secure vpn socket.Port it to the conference room.Why do you need a vpn socket?I'm bringing in a consultant from homeland toconfirm there are no lingering gaps in thecip firewall.That's fine. Take that downstairs.Ms.O'brian, larry moss.Welcome to the fbi.- You can call me chloe.- All right, we're right in here.Buchanan said you'd be up to speed.- I'm up.- Good.Agent walker and bauer are pursuinga potential lead on dubaku.They're en route to this addressin the mount pleasant district.Agent walker's requestingsatellite support.What's the matter?Is something wrong?I'm feeling a little exposed here.If someone out there is working for dubaku,shouldn't we be doing this more covertly?As far as anyone knows,you're working on shoring up our firewall.Besides, this is the only space availablewhere you'll have full access to our server.Our network doesn'tsupport remote modules.That's inefficient.Whoever set your network up that waydidn't know what they were doing.I set our network up that way.Okay.Something else?You worked with bauer for a long time,didn't you?Seven years, on and off.That's impressive.That you survived the experience.What are you talking about?Only that a lot of people didn'T.Curtis manning, ryan chapelle.His own wife.Are you saying it's jack'sfault his wife was killed?You tell me.Jack bauer is the most trustworthy,honorable man I know, and he'sy iend.Maybe you should worry less about him andmore about the mole in your office workingfor dubaku.- Is that chloe o'brian?- What?In the conference room. Chloe o'brian--she was senior analyst at ctu.I once took a seminar she gave.What's she doing here?Larry said homeland sent her over to checkfor residual breaches from thefirewall attack.What?It just doesn't sound likeher area of expertise.Besides, as far as I know, she's beeninactive since ctu was decommissioned.Your passports and travel itinerary.A hawker-siddley 748 isfueling at taft airfield.Be ready to fly within a half hour,get you to the cayman islands.You shouldn't have any troublegetting to belize from there.I need a car to theairfield and a driver.I assumed you had yourown transportation.It's not for me.I see. It's for the girl.Well, I'm not sure I can findsomeone I trust on such short notice.Really?What about your man at the bar?Excuse me?Or one of the two on thebalcony watching us now?Or the two in the black towncar waiting for me to leave?Do you think I am a fool,mr. Burnett?I know you people seeme as a liability now.These men are here to guarantee your safety,colonel, not to threaten it.Guarantee my safety. How nice.And said with such sincerity.I want you to take thismessage back with you.If anything should happen to meon my way out of the country--an accident or an assassinationattempt, anything--if the plane that you were so generousto donate decides to explode,a data file with all the names and banktransactions of all those involvedwill be sent to thejustice department.That is completely uecessary.The same holds true if anythingshould happen to marika donoso.I swear to you,she knows nothing of this.She is no threat to you.Make sure your driver knows thisbefore he brings her to me.Do you understand what I am saying?I want you to tell me that you understandwhat I am saying to you, so there will beno mistakes.- I understand.- Good.The one thing I have learned in thecompany of mercenaries, mr. Burnett,is that ultimately, they care aboutnothing but their own survival. Good day.I was right.Dubaku suspected we weregonna take him out,and apparently, he's assembled evidenceto use as an insurance policy.We need to make sure he gets out ofthe country and safely into exile.Otherwise, we're all compromised.I'll make the calls.What are you doing?Rosa.Where are you going?Rosa, listen to me.We're going away from here. All of us.Well, what do you mean, all?Samuel told me the truth.He's an illegal,just like you thought.He has to leave the country,and I've agreed to go with him.You're leaving me?No, no, only for a short time.You're gonna come, too.Samuel's made plans. We're gonnalive with him in his home in belize.Marika... he's lying to you.- He's not.- I won't let you do this!My god, rosa.I have taken care ofyou my entire life.I've sacrificed everything for you.Why can't you let me have this?I don't trust him.Oh, well, you never liked any manwho's ever shown an interest in me.Every chance I've ever had at happiness, youfound some way of ruining it. But notthis time.- Marika, I'm begging you, listen to me.- No.Marika, please. Stop.Move!Marika, please. Listen to me.I'm begging you, marik...fbi-- don't move!Get on your knees now!On your knees!Both of you, put your hands behind your head,interlock your fingers. Now!Do not move.We're clear.- Where is dubaku?- Who?Don't play games with me!Ike dubaku--we traced bank accounts to this address.Now, where is he?We don't know whoyou're talking about.Let me make try and makethis easier for you.You know this man?No.You're lying to me.Why are you lying to me?Let me see.That's him-- we know him.- He calls himself aboa, samuel aboa.- Rosa, shut up!She was going to meethim to leave me.Where were you gonna meet him?Where were you going?I don't know.- How do you know him?

I'll get back to you.We're on.Marika...we got to go.You-- fbi.You keep her safe, you hear me?We will.I'm really scared.You're going to be fine.Just remember,we're right behind you.Move up here.Now, listen, if you get into trouble,you can signal us by dialing one-zero...no. No, I don't want you to do that.Don't do anything that's going toraise the suspicion of the driver.Okay.You ready?I'm ready.Yeah.What the hell are you doing?She was scared.I wanted her to know there was anotheroption than waiting for us to swoop in.If we're going to find dubaku,there are no other options, you understand?Come on,you've run operations like this.Not without full tactical support,and at least two backup units on the scene.She's naked out there, jack.I don't like it.This isn't about you.This is about her and dubaku.Listen, life gets ugly,innocent people get hurt-- that's a reality.At least she got to make a choice tobe involved, to do the right thing.Which is a lot more than I cansay for dubaku's other victims.We have one job here--that's to get dubaku.Outside of that don't get involved.Chloe, the car's here.Copy that.She's getting in the car.Copy.She's moving. Are you cked in?Yeah, I've got themheading south on 14th.Can you upload the trackinggrid to agent walker's pda?No, I'll have to direct you.Just keep us close.Understood.

Whoa! What was it?What happened?Jack, we've got a problem.Chloe, what's wrong?- We just lost the tracking grid.- What?I-I don't know.It just suddenly glitched out.We can't afford to lose them.Jack, I gave this womanmy word we'd protect her.I know.Chloe, get it back up.We're doing our best, here, jack.Wait.It's back up.What the hell happened?I don't know,I'm running a diagnostic right now.Jack, they're moving southeaston massachusetts avenue.You've closed the gapto about a half mile.You may want to backoff a little bit.Okay, copy that.Oh, no.What?Somebody was in the system.What? What are you talking about?I'm saying someone in this officewas mirroring my terminal.Whoever it was knowsexactly what we were doing.Can you backtrace the breach?No.The link was severed.It could have come from anywhere.Jack, you getting this?It looks like we mighthave a security breach.Someone is mirroring our comm.Jack, they're coming from all sides.Larry, we got a situation here.what's going on?I got metro pds Trying tobuild a roadblock around us.What?Why would they be doing that?I don't know. Just get 'em off us!larry, do something!This is agent moss.Connect me with metrodistrict command.Hands in the air! Hands in the air!My name is jack bauerGet out of the car right now!my passenger is a federal agent.Get out of the car right now!She's a federal agent!Put your hands behindyour back, sir.Come on, larry, do something!Captain, you've got to releasethese people immediately!No. No, that is a mistake.No federal warrants havebeen issued for them!Yes, they have.A warrant was calledin for the vehicle.\"Occupants armed and dangerous,to be apprehended with decisive force.\"Issued by whom?Fbi. This office.There's no attribution,but the routing code's real.This was definitelydone by someone here.Marika's car just turnedeast onto n street.Captain, listen carefully.I'm the special agent in charge of thisoperation, and I am revoking thesewarrants immediately.No. No, I don't have time todeal with your chain of command.You need to releasethese people right now!Thank you.So is o'brian here to replace you?I don't know.No.Larry's using her for some kind ofcovert operation with jack bauer.They're tracking a car to dubaku.Why would he keep us in thedark about something like that?I don't know.I don't know, but I don't like it.Hey, I took care ofbauer and walker.They're pinned down.Why am I being brought inon this so last minute?Moss is running this op on his own.It took me some time totap into his phone line.He's on with metro right now.Can you at least disable the trackingsignal they're using to follow the girl?No, not from my console.But judging by the frequency,they're using her cell as the tracker.All right.Good work.You told me that once dubaku servedhis purpose, you'd take him out.Why are we still helping him?He's threatening to expose us using thedatabase he's kept with names and accounts ofeveryone involved.Including mine?I mean, everyone.We don't know where the file is,so you just better pray that he gets away.Yes, it has to do with the terroristthreats that happened this morning.hello?You got a problem.What is it?Your girlfriend's beenturned by the fbi.I don't believe you.They met with her a half hour ago,told her who you really are.That's impossible.Marika would never do this.I got it from our source inside the bureau,it is definite.She agreed to lead them to you,using her cell phone as a tracker.Look, my source managed to stalltheir surveillance team for a while,but you need to get tothe airfield immediately.I'll call my driver,have him take care of her.No.I'll do it.Colonel, I told you,they are tracking her.If you let her come to you,you're risking your chances of escape.I said, I'll take care of her!<font color=\"#ffff00\">-=www.ydy.com/bbs=-proudly presents</font><font color=\"#ffff00\">sync:ÈâÈâ&¸â¸â-=www.ydy.com/bbs=-</font><font color=\"#ffff00\">24Season 07 Episode 09</font>\n"
